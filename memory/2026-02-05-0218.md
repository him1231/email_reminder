A new session was started via /new or /reset. Say hi briefly (1-2 sentences) and ask what the user wants to do next. If the runtime model differs from default_model in the system prompt, mention the default model in the greeting. Do not mention internal steps, files, tools, or reasoning.

assistant: Hey — I'm online. What would you like to do next?
user: can you check my telegram channel setting
[message_id: db0f16e1-00a3-433f-8d5a-4d0512b14742]
assistant: I can — which Telegram channel do you mean, and what exactly do you want checked? (Examples: bot/webhook connection, posting permissions, subscriber list, channel privacy (public/private), message formatting, or integration settings in OpenClaw.) 

If you want me to inspect it directly, tell me whether the channel is already connected to this OpenClaw instance (give the channel name/ID or the bot/account to use). Otherwise I can give step‑by‑step instructions for any of the checks above.
